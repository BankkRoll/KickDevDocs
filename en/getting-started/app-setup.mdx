Create an app with KICK by following these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Account">
    Sign up for a KICK account if you haven't already. 
    
    Make sure to review our Developer Terms and Conditions to ensure your app complies with our access policies.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Two-Factor Authentication">
    Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to access our developer tools from your Kick Account settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to Developer Settings">
    Go to your Account Settings and select the [Developer](https://kick.com/settings/developer) tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Your App">
    Create an app to securely access our APIs via OAuth. This will generate a unique ClientID, ClientSecret, and a redirectURL specified by you.
    
    Upon successful authorization, KICK will redirect control to your redirectURL with a code to complete the [OAuth 2.0 Code Grant flow with PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build Your App">
    Use our documentation to guide you through the app development process.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch Your App">
    Release your app to users and start leveraging the Kick API! ðŸš€
