If you've made it here, thank you for wanting to contribute to our project!

We want the feedback process to be easy and streamlined. We have setup a single source of truth for feedback through our [public GitHub documentation repository](https://github.com/KickEngineering/KickDevDocs). This repository directly feeds back to this documentation website which allows you to edit and give feedback on the documentation and therefore the API.

Help us create and improve this product! We want your input and we want your feedback!

## GitHub Issues

  GitHub Issues is where feedback can be raised for us to consider. If you have feedback on our documentation, see if other people have raised the same idea and give us your thoughts!

We are looking for the following:

* Bug reports

## Discord

<Card title="Discord Community" icon="discord" href="https://discord.gg/kick">
